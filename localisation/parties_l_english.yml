 marxism_leninism_maoism:0 "Marxism-Leninism-Maoism"
 marxism_leninism_maoism_desc:0 "Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is a unique application of Leninist theory further developed with Maoist doctrine and thought. The ideology first began it's development with the writings of Mao Tse-Tung, written from a period spanning from the Long March (1934)to his passing in 1976. In Revolutionary Action, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism holds a differenting line from Marxism-Leninism in that Revolutions can only succed when the enemy army is demoralized and has class conciousness, and thus can be incorporated into the Revolutionary Army or be taken out of action, depending on whether the war is civil in nature or against a foreign power. This is mostly done via propaganda, terrorism, war crimes, and other such measures. For example in India the Naxalites frequently engage in Terrorism against the Indian Federal Government via bombings, assasination, etc, in order to demoralize the enemy forces. Also in Revolutionary strategy is the \"Three strategeuom\", in which a sequence of flexible revolutionary strategy is employed, those being Defensive Strategy, that being focusing on guerilla warfare, not fighting against superior forces, raiding enemy supplies, and the building of \"Revolutionary Bases\". The second is the Equiliberal Strategy in which a certain amount of territory is taken and held by the Revolutionaries, and a much more reconizable front line is created and held. The final phase is in which the enemy army is seeing mass defection and collapse, and in which a quick offensive is made in Blitzkrieg fashion and the enemy is crushed. Of course these are not the only revolutionary strategy utilized by Marxist-Leninist-Maoists, and for further reading please read \"On Protracted War\" as well as the works of Chairman Gonzolo. Another distinction Maoists hold from that of Marxists-Leninists is that they consider Josef Stalin and all other other Soviet Leaders with the exception of Lenin to be \"Revisionist\" and see the truest application of Socialism to be that of under Mao Zedong. They are also Vanguardist and that the peasentry and people in the countryside are an instrumental part of building socialism and the revolution. One thing that is also unique to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is that practioners of it believe in the Cultural Revolution as a means to purge the party, and society, of bourgeois and right wing interests. For more on this you can read the works by Chairman Mao, Chairman Gonzolo, and the various blogs that their modern practioneers have created."
 marxism_leninism:0 "Marxism-Leninism"
 marxism_leninism_desc:0 "Marxism-Leninism is the synthesis of Leninist and Marxist thought into a unique doctrine. Marxism-Leninism holds that while Marx was right in that Revolution was inevitable, though because the bourgeoise would entice the proletariate with a welfare state taken from places that the proletariate, expressing childish nationalism as Lenin put it, would not care about. Thus the proletariate would not be facing serious exploitation and class conciousness would not grow among them, thus meaning that revolution could be stopped from coming to fruition. The solution, as Lenin thought it, was to have a Vanguard of devoted professional revolutionaries educate the prolitariate and foster class conciousness in that way, and thus get the gears rolling to a Revolution. Other concepts created from Marxism-Leninism is the idea of the dictatorship of the prolitariate which expresses the interests of the prolitariate via the election of representative democracy to officals to the Legislature which was then elect the executive. Several criticisms of this ideology are the fact that the Vanguard has the unquestioned right to do whatever it felt to be necessary to ensure the dictatorship of the proletarite. This had led to a multitude of highly controversial decisions which many have argued is not conducive to a true dictatorship of the prolitariate. Infighting is also quite common among Marxist-Leninists, with them often discussing the concept of revisionism in the Soviet Union and other Socialist States expressed or express it. That being, the needing of the Vanguard to be \"Infiltrated\" with right wing elements and thus leading to erroneous decisions. Further reading includes the works of Vladimir Lenin, the works of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Kruschev, Enver Hoxha, and any modern Marxist-Leninist works."
 trotskyism:0 "Trotskyism"
 trotskyism_desc:0 "Trotskyism holds that Marxists-Leninists did not in reality support the working class and fell into deep class collaboration, revisionism, and ended up losing their status as dictatorship of the proletariate. Trotskyism believes in Lenin's presuppitions on the Vanguard, Revolution, and the idea of a dictatorship of the proletariate, though they believe that after 1928 with the election of Joseph Stalin to the General Secretary was rigged and that the Soviet Union then allowed Capitalist elements to come to it and for all intents and purposes lost it's dictatorship of the proletariate. Trotskyists believe that the revolution hub should also wage a war against the capitalist powers in an effort to liberate the proletariate of the world. Also very important to them is the concept of Permanent Revolution in order to ensure that counter revolutionary elements do afflict the Communist Party and bueracratic structure is not allowed to infest and pollute the revolution in their view. Also very important to them is the idea of ensuring genuine proletarian democracy in a one party representative or direct democracy. For more information read Trotsky's works, and the pamplhlets and informational works on various Trotskyist organizations and websites."
 right_leninism:0 "Market Socialism"
 right_leninism_desc:0 "Market Socialism is a ideology that believes that each workers union or Soviet should have the right to form a cooperative and compete with each other on a market. The idea stems from the New Economic Policy or NEP which the Soviet Union engaged in from 1922 to 1928, and was most famously advocated for by Nikolai Bukharin and Josip Broz Tito. The system tends to hold the Leninist view on the Vanguard and the idea of Revolution but more reformist elements most certainly do exist in the system. These systems tend to be less concerned with Revisionism and thus tend to be more pluralistic then Marxist-Leninist or Trotskyist regimes, but at the same time also tend to advocate for far more elitist politics then their much more populistic counterparts. Market Socialism has only seen limited use in the real world, but The New Economic Policy by Vladimir Lenin as well as looking at academic works on the subject is also a good place to start."
 orthodox_leninism:0 "Leninism"
 orthodox_leninism_desc:0 "Orthodox Leninism refers to the group of Soviet politicans during the 1920's power struggle who didn't allign with the Trotskyist, Right-Leninist (Bukharinite), or Stalinists and instead formed the Left-Bloc made up of Kamenev, Zinoviev, and other such elements. These people advocated for the strenghening of inter-socialistic unity, the abolishment of the Bolshevik monopoly on the Vanguard, the ending of the New Economic Policy, and instead focusing on Industrialization via a planned economy and encouraging Worker Self-Managment, as well as the advocation of a pluralistic society. Stalin would later ally and join this bloc later down the road but also not adopt many of their policies which he viewed as Revisionist and counter-revolutionary. This group would fall in irrevelancy and can only be found in histories of this time in Soviet History."
 orthodox_marxism:0 "Marxism"
 orthodox_marxism_desc:0 "Orthodox Marxism refers to people who only use the theories of Karl Marx for their advocacy, planning, and execution for the building of a socialist society and a revolution. This most famously includes the likes of Eugene Debs as someone who little to no knowlege or influence of Leninist or Reformist doctrine who instead were \"purely\" Marxist. This group tends to advocate more for a pluralistic society and does not hold that the Dictatorship of the Proletariate should result in the ending of political rights to counter revolutionary forces. Workers' Self Managment also tends to be the primary mode of production among this ideology."
 syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism refers to the idea that the Union should form the primary bloc of political, economic, and cultural society. It soared in popularity around the turn of the 20th century and remains to have a following in Western Europe."
 sorelianism:0 "Sorelianism"
 sorelianism_desc:0 "Sorelianism is an idea that bourgeois society leads to corruption and degeneracy culturally and economically and thus a Revolution is needed to replace Capitalist Society and that parliamentary revolutionism, ie the Vanguard Party, will lead to degeneracy and corruption. It also is not Marxist in that True Communism is impossible in their view and that the best option is eternal revolution against the \"Establishment\". It is different from normal Socialistic ideologies in that it is highly culturally reactionary and against things such as gay rights, open sexuality, cultural relativism, but is anti-racist. It is also highly nationalistic viewing their nation as the ultimate expression of morality and wishing to save and preserve that idea. It is highly ethical and aesthetical with minimal concrete ideas and thus has been seen as more of a building bloc for more concrete and influential ideas such as Leninism and Fascism."
 spartacism:0 "Spartacism"
 spartacism_desc:0 "Spartacism is an anti-Leninist revolutionary Socialist ideology popularized by Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebnieckt. They are a part of the original First Internationale Group that were also part of the Zimmerwald Left during WWI. It believes in a dictatorship of the proletariate as well as Leninists, but wholly rejects the Vanguard movement."
 anarcho_communism:0 "Anarcho-Communism"
 anarcho_communism_desc:0 "Anarcho-Communism is an ideology that holds that humanity is naturally good and wholeistic and that if the unjust power hierchies are abolished a utopia will soon follow. It heavily rebukes the idea that a state is needed to transition into communism and believes that direct democracy is the best action to abolish capitalism and lead to a utopian regime."
 anarcho_primitivism:0 "Anarcho Primitivism"
 anarcho_primitivism_desc:0 "Anarcho Primitivism is an ideology that is transcedentalist in nature that believes that by completely abandoning the material world and leaving society to only focus on the individual a person will become a sort of transcedental enlightened person. This group is a catch all for any group that decides to abandoning society and abandoning all material ways of life in exchange for some higher meaning. This can range anywhere from Deep Ecology, to extreme Traditionalism, to exceptionally radical libertarianism, to concepts such as Soulism."
 classical_anarchism:0 "Anarchism"
 classical_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarchism holds that the state of all kinds has a monopoly on violence and that that is absolutely unjust and must be overturned at once. The ideal for humanity is where we all live decentralized communal esque society without the influence of a powerful state."
 anarcho_capitalism:0 "Anarcho Capitalism"
 anarcho_capitalism_desc:0 "Anarcho Capitalism is an ideology that holds that enterprises should have absolute freedom while engaging is bussiness with customers and each other, held together by a general pacifist cultural concept called the Non-Agression Principle or NAP. A major difference between it and other anarchist ideologies is the idea of a purely meritocratic society not based on supposed statist or corptocratic corruption of modern Capitalism, instead a pure, free capitalistic society. For example, the idea is that for, for example, the police forces are not good at their jobs because they rely on a state, which is inheritantly collectivist, and thus fosters corruption and lack of quality as opposed to how it would function if owned or operated as a corporation, because the profit motive would mean that it act within the rules of economy and thus be far better then it's statist counterpart. Anarcho-Capitalists tend to point to Iceland around the time it was first colonized by Norweigans around the 11th century as a supposed Anarcho-Capitalist society that was \"Significantly better then the rest of Feudal Europe\". -libertarians.org. But beyond this there have been no real life examples of Anarcho-Capitalism in the real world. For more reading please read Freiman, as well as it's entry on libertarians.org."
 national_anarchism:0 "Anarcho-Fascism"
 national_anarchism_desc:0 "Anarcho Fascism is an idea that was first founded by Jonas Nillson in that the anarchist mode of society is the best mode of society for the organization of people of a shared race and best preserves masculinity, morality, and culture against encroachment of liberalism and \"weakness\"."
 dengism:0 "Dengism"
 dengism_desc:0 "Dengists believe in an evolutionary form of Socialism, and that Socialism can only come out of Capitalism, but that a socialist state must exist in order to develop productive forces and protect the transition to socialism once Capitalism is sufficently developed to a \"developed\" state, or to a state that has a Capitalist mode of production, while headed by a Dictatorship of the Proletariate to develop Socialism once Capitalism is sufficently developed. It was first theorized by Deng Xiaoping in the 1970's, and is the current ideology of the People's Republic of China."
 democratic_socialism:0 "Democratic Socialism"

 left_wing_populism:0 "Left Wing Populism"
 left_wing_populism_desc:0 "Left-Wing Populism is an anti-establishmentarian ideology that forms in mostly Right-Wing and Liberal states that seeks to bring social and or economic change to a given state, particularly in a socialistic and left-wing direction. Historically this can be as tame as the implementation of a bigger or the creation of a welfare state, to as radical to the demanding of the breakup of big bussiness and land reform. A common trait however, with notable exceptions, is that Left-Wing populists do not tend to not advocate for Revolution, instead mostly for electoral power in which to implement their agenda. They tend to be very democratic and have even led the charge for the breakup of right-wing dictatorships, though much more radical and authoritarian strains do exist."
 conservative_socialism:0 "Conservative Socialism"
 conservative_socialism_desc:0 "Conservative Socialism is a concept that is socially conservative and economically left wing. They tend to support economic left wing policies like a welfare state, the breaking up of big bussiness, unions, and such, but tend to support right wing policies such as anti-gay marraige, pro-life, anti trans rights, and, mostly, religous values. Conservative Socialists don't tend to be particularly revolutionary except as part of a broad revolutionary coalition in dictatorial situations or coalitions of popular left wing movements. They tend to both despise most right wingers as \"bootlickers\" and see them as sucking up to degenerate corporate influence, while at the same time disliking left wingers for their militant support of progressive social policies and anti-religous attitudes. Thus, they do not tend to be very popular in the scope of liberal democratic politics, though in recent years they have found support among dispossessed religous people in South America as well as Islamic strains in the Islamic World, most particularly Palestine, and continue to grow in these areas as well as seeing some support among traditional communities in the United States."

It also tends to be highly moralist and nationalist. The movement first started during the Reagan years as a popular talking point of conservative evangelical radio shows, and the term quickly became a soundbite for the Reagan administration and a description of it's policies. But however, though they did not go by the name, this history of compassionate Conservatism goes back far longer then this relatively modern Reaganite invention."

The ideology has been around as old as time, but in more contemporary terms right-wing populism is an ideology that holds that the moneyed classes are corrupt and degenerate and that only a true return to true Populist governance can save it, and restore it to it's former glory. 1\nRight Wing Populism also tends to be nationalistic and very pro preserving it's cultural heritage against the tide of a liberal or socialistic encursion. Right Wing Populists thus tend to be very supportive of their culture and society and very much anti anyone who would dare threaten those values or ideals. Thus, right wing populists tend to support things that go against the mainstream liberal or socialistic culture in an effort to revolt against them. Right Wing Populist movements can be found all over the world."
 national_progressivism:0 "National Progressivism"
 national_progressivism_desc:0 "National Progressivism refers to an ideology that is centered on the ideal of the modern nation state, and is beset on modernizing that nation, by any means necessary.

But the main idea is that the nation in question will be dragged into the modern world, kicking and screaming if need be."
 dictatorial_democracy:0 "Dictatorial Democracy"
 dictatorial_democracy_desc:0 "Dictatorial Democracy is an idea that holds that in times of great crisis or if need be a strongman could rise and take control of the central state apparatus in order to save Democracy. This concept goes back as far as the ancient Greeks, but was most famously utilized by the Romans in an attempt to ensure that the nation would survive a particularly difficult crisis. There are countless examples of dictators temporarily suplanting democracy in an effort to save it, some more humane and democratic then others, but still the concept of utilizing the state by one selfless, or self described selfless, demonstrates the concept of dictatorial democracy."

 traditionalism:0 "Traditionalism"
 traditionalism_desc:0 "Traditionalism is an ideology that wishes to return to an idyllic pre enlightenment and pre industrial past of honor and chivalry, regardless of culture. Traditionalism holds that the concepts of the enlightenment, reason above all else, freedom of speech, the market place of ideas, etc, are concepts that are based on nothing. The only social systems that have a basis are those that take into account that of human nature and that of morality in a world, ie, anti-liberalism, and the forced keeping of said power and cherishing it against all outside threats against it. It is highly anti any other ideologies or threats to it's culture's existence, and vicouslessly will defend against supposed cultural intrution and degeneraction. They are a development out of the reaction to the French Revolution, most personified by Edmund Burke's essay on said Revolution."
 futurism:0 "Futurism"
 futurism_desc:0 "While I in haste and in effort listen to the metalic clashing of sounds via a transmission of a radio signal traveling at speeds incomporable to man, flooding into my ears as the struggle of typing picks up with haste as the evening dawns, preparing me to give readers of tomorrow a reading on the manifesto of Futuri, or Futurism in the modern English and American sense of the word. Right now my fingers frantically thump on a keyboard lighting up the projecter with a beautiful array of orange from the program while the recording of the song recorded in a much more ancient and superstituous picks up in tempo thus igniting my esctatic thoughts as the typing gets more and more foreful with every character, leading to a great excitment in my mind as time seems to slowly melt as all that remains is the simple glow of the moniter, which further invigorates the whole ideal, thus reminding me of my original task, a description of the Futurist thought. Futurism is a spirit that was born in the tumultous timeframe of the early 20th century when everyone was simply RUSHING, no where to go, cars could now drive faster then had ever been dreamed of, the once quiet and quaint view of the city was soon chiming with the clang of industry and mondernity, and old culture was being thrown out in the face of an all encompasing fast mechanical future, one free from the superstiton and the slowness of the past into a glorious new future.
